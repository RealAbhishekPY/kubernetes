# kubernetes
 K8s, is a powerful open-source platform for managing containerized applications across clusters of servers.
**Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.
**Scalability**: It can scale applications up or down based on demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
**Self-Healing**: Kubernetes can automatically restart failed containers, replace them, and reschedule them when nodes fail, ensuring high availability.
**Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: It provides built-in mechanisms for service discovery and load balancing, making it easier to manage and distribute traffic to your applications.
**Declarative Configuration**: You can define your applicationâ€™s desired state using YAML or JSON files, and Kubernetes will work to maintain that state.
Extensibility: Kubernetes has a rich ecosystem of plugins and extensions, allowing you to customize and extend its functionality to meet your needs.
